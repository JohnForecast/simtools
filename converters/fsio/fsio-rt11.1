.TH FSIO-RT11 1 "May 15,2019" "FFS I/O - RT-11"
.SH NAME
fsio-rt11 \- Foreign File System I/O - RT-11
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBfsio\fP allows access to RT-11 file systems using the file system type
"\fIrt11\fP"
.br
.SH RT-11 VERSIONS
There were 5 major versions of RT-11 released. Versions 1 and 2 did not use
the home block (block 1) to indicate that the on-disk file structure was RT-11
format. The remaining 3 versions wrote a signature on the home block
including the file system version in use. In order to access a version 1 or
version 2 container file, the \fI"-f"\fP switch must be used on the
\fI"mount"\fP command to force \fBfsio\fP
to bypass the home block checks. While \fBfsio\fP will use a set of
heuristics to verify the integrity of the RT-11 file structure it is possible
that an invalid file structure will satisfy the checks and cause \fBfsio\fP to
fail. Do not use the \fI"-f"\fP switch other than to mount version 1 or
version 2 file systems.

.br
The VMS exchange utility may be used to initialize an RT-11 volume but writes
it's own unique signature in the home block. \fBfsio\fP is able to correctly
handle this signature.
.SH LOGICAL DISKS
\fBfsio\fP can be used to access an RT-11 logical disk if the file has been
copied to the host file system.
.SH WILDCARD CHARACTERS
The wildcard character \fI'%'\fP may be used to match a single character in a
filename or type. The wildcard character \fI'*'\fP may be used to match
zero or more characters in a filename or type. Wildcard characters are only
valid with the \fIdir\fP command.
.br
.SH NEWFS OPERATION
\fInewfs\fP creates a blank MSCP image (32MB, 65535 blocks) with a single
partition which can be accessed via the DU device (rq in SIMH). If the
\fI"-t type"\fP switch is present, a smaller container file will be created
depending on the type of device specified:
.br
.RS
.TP
\fIrl02\fP    \- RL02 image (10MB, 20480 blocks)
.br
.TP
\fIrx20\fP    \- RX20 image (512KB, 1024 blocks)
.br
.RE
.SH COPY OPERATION
When copying in ASCII mode, \fBfsio\fP will normally write ^Z (octal 032) to
indicate the end-of-file. Some utilities, such as FLX on RSX-11, cannot
handle ^Z in the middle of a formatted ASCII file. The \fI"-p"\fP switch
may be used on a copy operation to skip writing the ^Z and pad the file with
NULLs up to the next block boundary if this occurs.
.br
.SH SET OPERATION
No \fIset\fP commands are currently supported.
