Changes Since Alpha Release:

1. mount: Fix memory leak when file system verification fails

2. dos11: Fix hang when parsing wildcard programmer number

3. Migrate to using GNU readline library for command line editing etc

4. local: Fix buffering so that local "type" command works

5. Add DOS-11 magtape support using file system type "dosmt"

6. newfs: Remove -a switch. Replace with "-t type" switch to allow more
   flexibility. The equivalent of "-a" is now "-t rl02".

12-Jun-19

- Added support for sector interleave on RX01/RX02 drives

  - Now supports creating RX01-sized container files
  - Now works with RTFLX on TOPS-10 with RX02-sized container files
    (documentation updated)

25-Jun-19

- Added support for OS/8 file systems on RX01, RX02 and RK05 drives using
  file system type "os8"

- Added support for creating RT-11 file systems with additional space
  allocated to each directory entry

9-Jan-20

- Merged change from tvrusso to fix compilation on FreeBSD

20-Aug-20

- Fixed bug in OS/8 file deletion which incorrectly reduced the directory
  file count by 1

- Fix ASCII mode read in OS/8 where it would read an entire block into
  memory rather than a single line. When copying to local:, this would
  result in the destination file having unexpected <CR> characters.

  using file system type "unixv7"

- Added support for RK06 and RK07 Unix V7 drives

13-Nov-24

- Fixed OS/8 ASCII file read/write to to handle ^Z marking the end of file

- Fixed RT11 scan to find the size of the partition. The old code would
  incorrectly terminate on an EMPTY marker rather than END-OF-SEGMENT.
