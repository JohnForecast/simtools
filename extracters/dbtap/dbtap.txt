dbtap manipulates .tap magtape container files used by SIMH and written in
DOS/BATCH-11 file format. dbtap is invoked by:

        dbtap -lcae [-r len -A <list> -E -S -P pg,pj] container [...]

To list the contents of one or more container files:

        dbtap -l container ...

To create a new container file and append file(s):

        dbtap -c [-r len -A <list> -S -P pg,pj] container file ...

To append file(s) to an existing container:

        dbtap -a [-r len -A <list> -S -P pg,pj] container file ...

To extract file(s) from container(s):

        dbtap -e [-A <list> -E] container ...

Switches:

    -r len      Specify max tape record size when writing.
                (512 <= len <= 65536).

    -A <list>   By default, files are transferred in Binary mode. This switch
                is used to specify file extensions which should be transferred
                in Ascii mode (e.g. ".MAC:.BAT" or ".MAC,.BAT").

    -E          Include prog,proj in filename when extracting.
                (e.g. FILE_ggg_jjj.EXT").

    -S          DOS/BATCH-11 uses 6+3 (name+extension) for filenames including
                on magtape. Over time, the magtape definition changed to
                allow 9+3 filenames by adding an extra word to the filename
                record. By default, this program uses the 9+3 format but
                the -S switch may be used to force 6+3 filenames when writing
                to tape.

    -P pg,pj    Specify prog,proj number when writing to tape. Numbers are in
                octal. Default is [1,1].
