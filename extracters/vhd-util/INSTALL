This is a port of the Xen vhd-util tool and the libvhd library to windows.

It still works (with minor enhancements) on Unix.

The distribution kit includes prebuilt executables for Linux and Windows.

There are two components:
      libvhd - library for VHD file access
      vhd-util - tool for managing VHD files.

Each has a directory, which should be at the same level.

On Unix:
   cd vhd-util && make && make install

   cd vhd-util && make PREFIX=/usr && make PREFIX=/usr
   To place somewhere else.

   This creates a sharable library (libvhd) and the vhd-util command.

On Windows:
   Builds under microsoft Visual Studio (2015), free edition.

   Open libvhd/libvhd.sln and build it.

On Windows, a DLL is NOT created as the API doesn't support it.
(The DLL allocates memory that the client must free, but doesn't
 provide routines to do this.  On windows, the pools are different.)

Licensing is described in COPYING.
